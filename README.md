## Technologies Used

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/display/) 
    - The navigation bar and footer and login/register portions of the website were built with a template from **bootstrap** to speed up development. However, the template's layout and theme have been modified from its original version to blend those functionalities with the rest of the site.   
    The homepage.html, charity.html, and about.html page's content/body section were built from scratch by me using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.

[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - **Fontawesome** was used to style the fonts of the project.

[Viewport](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp) 
    - Meta name **viewport** was also added in order to make the site responsive to different sizes of screen.
a <link> was added to the site to make the site able to run JavaScript (thumbs up functionality required it.)
  
  [JQuery](https://jquery.com) and [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - The project uses **JQuery and javascript** to make features responsive to customer's actions (thumbs up functionality required it).


## Testing

Automated tests were not performed.

1. Navigation bar:
    1. Go to the "Homapage" page
    2. Click on all links and buttons to see if they work and take the user to the pages they meant to go.
    3. Change the size of the screen to make sure that the navbar is presentable
    4. Click the links and button again in different size of screens to verify they still work (mainly when hamburger icon shows).

2. Content section of homepage:
    1. Go to the "Homepage" page
    2. Make sure that the content is readable and properly laid out.
    3. Click the "thumbs" to make sure that they work well in terms of functionality and effects.
    4. Change sizes of the screens to make sure that the site is still presentable and functional on those sizes.

3. Content section of other pages:
    1. Go to the "homepage" page and click on the link "Charity" from the navigation bar.
    2. Make sure that the content is presentable in all sizes of screens and that the button work.
    3. Click on the link "About Us" from the navigation bar.
    4. Make sure the content of the page is presentable in all sizes of screen.
    5. Make sure that the text box are working on all sizes of the screen by typing text in them to make the digits shows there.

    (*CLARIFICATION NOTE: Testing screen size means -> by increasing and decreasing the browser window and using developer tools to test site on mobile view.*)


**The pages in this website will be more simple in the mobile view compared to desktop view. For example:**
- links in the menu navigator will be replaced by the hamburger icon.
- The footer portion related to social media, will present only the icons (no text "Social Media").
- Content body sections were made with grid system bootstrap, which mean that, in mobile view or small screens, the column will be presented on top of each other as rows.

**Bugs:**  
The project had its challenges, but I was not able to identify bugs. Except for the two following bugs:
- The browser when on a range of 450px-525px width, did not recognize the properties inside of CSS rule @media that included that width range. I redo the code using grid system and the issue got solved. My previous code that had the issue was built by me using the div and box system (without bootstrap grid system).
- I had an issue where the footer was shown in the middle of the page about.html. I checked the developer tool and found that the footer was that way because because <html> default dimentions. I was able to fix the issue by adding bootstrap fixed-bottom class to the footer.
